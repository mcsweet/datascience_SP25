*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these different variables. Unless we're careful and thorough, we can easily miss these patterns. In this challenge you'll analyze a dataset with a small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Needs Improvement | Satisfactory |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Effort | Some task **q**'s left unattempted | All task **q**'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations, or observations incorrect | Documented correct observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not clearly supported by analysis | All observations clearly supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Assessed | Observations include claims not supported by the data, or reflect a level of certainty not warranted by the data | Observations are appropriately qualified by the quality & relevance of the data and (in)conclusiveness of the support |
| Specified | Uses the phrase "more data are necessary" without clarification | Any statement that "more data are necessary" specifies which *specific* data are needed to answer what *specific* question |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

df_titanic <- as_tibble(Titanic)
```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about 67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

**Observations**:

-   Class
-   Sex
-   Age
-   Survived
-   N

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

```{r q2-summary}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

**Observations**:

-   According to the Wikipedia article there were 2,224 souls aboard the titanic and about 1500 died
-   The data set says there were a total of 2201 souls on the titanic ship
-   Are there any differences?
    -   The number given by Wikipedia and the data set are off by 23 people. That is about 0.01% of the population aboard the ship. That is a statistically small amount.
-   If yes, what might account for those differences?
    -   The data set and Wikipedia could have references different data sources or historical records of the event. From Wikipedia it seems that they did not have an accurate counting method or attendance list. Especially when Wikipedia says that sources do not agree on how many lives were lost.
    -   That being said the data could not account for certain types of passengers. Maybe people snuck on the ship or did end up traveling. Those would alter the actual number of people on the ship from the number of tickets sold.

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

```{r q3-task}
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`

survived_q3 <-
  df_titanic %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes')

survived_q3 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, n, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

**Observations**:

-   The men who were crew are the largest surviving population. I need to know what percent of passengers are crew. If there was 5x as many crew than passengers than these higher survival numbers would make sense. There are a lot of conclusions that can not be jumped to because of the lack of specificity in the data here.
-   In first and send class more women survived than men. I once again do not know what proportion this is of the total women in 1st and 2nd class there were aboard the titanic.
-   Few female crew members survived. I need to know how many female passengers there were in total before knowing if this was actually most of the students
-   This graph tells me information but provides so little context to it. So to draw conclusions it is hard. There must be better ways to display this information
-   I wonder how many people were in each class. 2nd class had the least amount of survivors but they might've just been a small population.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for understanding differences between groups. This is because the differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.[1]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age` group.

```{r compute-prop}
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

```{r q4-task}

df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, Prop, fill = Sex)) +
  geom_col()
```

**Observations**:

-   Prop â€“\> is the proportion of the people in that category that survived
-   Write your observations here.
    -   Women had higher survival capabilities than men across all fronts.
    -   Even tho the probability goes about 2... it looks like a majority of females survived in 1st and 2nd class. 3rd class and Crew females had lower survival rates. Even tho we know that crew had the most people survive of all the groups, they have the lowest proportion of survival.
    -   3rd class in comparison to 1st and 2nd class had a lower percent of survival. I wonder if this is due to prioritization of wealthy people and/or the fact that 3rd class was deeper into the boat in terms of levels
        -   Technically I can't say this. I would have to undo the fishiness before making any claims/observations
-   Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
    -   The proportions go to 3. Proportions should always be out of 1. This is really confusing to try to understand. 2 full proportions of females in 1st class survived. Why is it not max 1? If we look at the data there are two rows that have female and 1st class. They differ in the age group. So it much be that almost all female children survived and almost all female women survived

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don't forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider additional variables!

```{r q5-task}
df_prop %>% 
  filter(Survived == 'Yes') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Class, Prop, fill = Age)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(rows = 'Sex')




  
```

**Observations**:

-   In all classes for all age ranges females had a larger proportion of survivors. During crisis women and children are typically saved first and I remember learning about that with the titanic.
-   I am surprised by the large perfect of female crew that survived especially in comparison to the male crew members.
-   Male children survived proportionally larger than men. While female children survived almost proportionally the same as the female adults.
-   It is extremely clear that adult women tend to have a higher survival rate than any class of men. Women in 1st and 2nd class were almost all saved while men in 1st class only at 0.5 probability of survive and 2nd class men had about 0.15 probability of survival. This is crazy different.
-   If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain the fishy-ness.
    -   When the proportions were calculated they included seperation of age group. So for every class and sex there were two proportions being put together in seemingly one category in q4. In this plot I separated out the results by Sex, Age, and Class. As we seperate two categories from each other we can not tell was every section is refering directly to. I know what the proportion of survivors was we male, 2nd class, kids not just all 2nd class males.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

[1] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
